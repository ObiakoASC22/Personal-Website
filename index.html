        <p class = "aboutP">Hi, I am Obiako Nwakile. I am a 15-year old rising junior who attends<br> Fordham Preparatory School.
        I enjoy gaming, coding, watching videos<br>
        and shows, learning new ways to improve myself, and being productive. <br>
        My favorite colors are red, blue, purple, and black. My favorite subject <br>
        is math and my least favorite is social studies.

        <p class = "aboutPH2 aboutP2">Since I have a deep interest in computer science, I want a career pertaining to that field.<br>
        Although I have not decided on what job I want to pursue, I am coming to a conclusion on web designing.
        Through prior experience in certain programs, I always had the most fun in coding the design for websites as opposed to typing the code. </p>

        <p class = "eduP">Since COVID-19 struck, I did not have the opportunity to take challenging<br>
        courses in my freshman year. My school did not allow us to take any entrance<br> 
        exams for higher level courses. Luckily, I was able to take one honors course,<br>
        that one being Geometry Honors. The other courses were core: Biology, <br>
        English 1, Global 1, Religious Studies 1, Intro To Computers, Phys Ed, <br>
        and Latin 1. I did not let covid stop me from applying to more challenging<br>
        in my sophomore year. I ended up adding 3 more honors classes to my<br>
        schedule including a 7th subject. I took Chemistry Honors, Global 2 Honors, <br>
        English 2, Precalculus Honors, Phys Ed, Religious Studies 2, Latin 2 Honors, <br>
        and Studio Art 1. For my junior year, the current year of my high school experience, <br>
        I chose to take 3 APs, 2 honors, and a different 7th subject. As much as I wanted<br>
        to take the AP computer science course this year, it could not fit my schedule.<br>
        The courses I'm taking this year are AP Calculus AB, AP Physics 1, AP English<br>
        Language, Latin 3 Honors, U.S. History Honors, Phys Ed, and Religious Studies 3.</p>

            <p class = "extraP">Again, because COVID-19 ruined a lot of things , in my freshman year, I was not able<br>
            to participate in anything. I felt like my freshman year was a waste since I did not<br>
            get to do anything besides academics. This inspired me to be active in my school <br>
            once everything goes back to normal. In my sophomore year, I participated in many clubs and one sport.
            I did outdoors track and field as a sport, and for the clubs I participated in the Diversity Alliance, 3D Print, Robotics, Ping Pong, and Chess.
